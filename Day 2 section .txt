About git add and git commit

Create a repository in ur local machine, by gioving git init 

Repository Name would be My First Repository

if we create some text files to that repository

That text file should track when those files should be in Staging area 

To send those files to Staging area , we should use git add command 

if we add file then u should write command like as : git add file name eg : git add first_file.txt

Or else if we want add all created files then u should use command as follow : git add .

Those files are tracking now, 

And commit those files into repository by using command git commit and message as follow 

Use like : git commit -m "my first commit on first_file"

if u modify anything on files , then also u should add those changes by using git add and git commit commnds

And lastly u check the status of repo by using git status command.

So before we jump into using git fetch and git pull, let's quickly show you how to use git log, since

it's a useful mechanism to understand how git fetch and get pull are actually working.

The git log command will show a list of all the commits made to a repository, including the hash message

and other metadata.

You can think of it as a history of a repo.

We can quickly check this with git status and we haven't made any other commits and everything's up

to date.

So git log you can see is showing us all those commits that we made.

It shows     who the author that was,
                 the username, 
				 the email, 
				 the user email,
				 the date of that commit,
        and then the actual actions that were taken along with the message.
        you can see here message modified,
    		                     modified added bunches,
								 add it to files and if it's a longer

a log, you're going to have to hit enter here to continue going through the log.

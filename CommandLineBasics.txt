Change directories (cd)
Make a new directory (mkdir)
List files in new directory (dir)


C:\Users\vasudevarao\

If I want to go back up to users or down to another folder, I need to figure out what folders are available

C:\Users\vasudevarao>dir

that will list everything that's currently in this directory.

So as I scroll down I can see I have lots of files here located under my directory.

For example, one of them is desktop.

So if I wanted to change to the desktop,

C:\Users\vasudevarao> cd Desktop


C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop>

C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop>dir

I can run dir again to see all the files I have on my desktop.

If you ever want to clear everything that's on your command prompt,

C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop>cls

So let's imagine.

I want to go back up a directory, essentially going back up a file.

So instead of my desktop, I just want to go back to vasudevarao.

To do that.

C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop>cd ..

I change directory space and then two dots and that brings you back up a directory.

C:\Users\vasudevarao>cd ..

C:\Users>

So if I want to see what users I have, I can type dir


C:\Users>dir

I can see users 

And then I can see into any of the folders listed here so I can change directory back into my account.

C:\Users>



C:\Users>cd vasudevarao

C:\Users\vasudevarao>

And then if I wanted to, I could change directory into, for example, my downloads

C:\Users\vasudevarao\Downloads>

C:\Users\vasudevarao\Downloads>cls

And now underneath desktop I'm going to make a new directory, which is essentially the same thing as

making a new folder.

This is essentially the exact same thing as when you right click on your desktop and hit new folder.

To do this, you simply say mkdir for make directory space and then the folder you want to make such

 C:\Users\vasudevarao\Downloads>cd ..
 
 C:\Users\vasudevarao>cd Desktop
 
 C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop>mkdir myNewFolder
 
 as myNewFolder hit enter and now you'll actually see a new folder on your desktop called myNewFolder
 
 C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop>cd myNewfolder
 
 C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>dir

C:\Users\vasudevarao>

C:\Users\vasudevarao>git config user.name

Git Diff : 
       
	   When working with multiple branches or file vesrions , it's useful that can display the differnces
	   
	   Which display the differnces between the original file and unstaged file
	   
Example : I created a new file and added some lines then I use git add and git commit

          
C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\brand_new_folder>git add .

C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\brand_new_folder>git commit -m "original file "
[master 06f7347] original file  
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 diff.txt  

"Now , I change the same file and see the differnces by using git diff"

C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\brand_new_folder>git diff

diff --git a/diff.txt b/diff.txt

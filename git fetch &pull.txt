There are two options of getting repo changes from remote repo (github) to local repo
1.git fetch
2.git pull

git fetch 
downloads the changes from the remote repository but does not automatically merge them with the local repository.

It updates the remote-tracking branches in the local repository to reflect the changes in the remote repository.

This command is useful when you want to see the changes made in the remote repository before merging them with your local branch.



   
		  


git pull 
downloads the changes from the remote repository and immediately merges them with the local repository. 

It is essentially a combination of git fetch and git merge commands in one. 

This command is useful when you want to quickly update your local repository 

with the changes in the remote repository without going through the extra step of manually merging them.

It is important to note that when using git pull,

if there are any conflicts between the local and remote branches,

you will need to resolve them manually before committing the changes.

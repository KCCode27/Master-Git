We have learned 
How to create a local repo and add changes to staging area and then commit to main(master) branch we have locally

If u are using GitHub as hosting service we can think of this as a remote branch

Let's learn How to push local code to a remote branch on GitHub

We can check for remote branches with the command    git remote -v

If you run this command on a cloned repo, you will view the URL of the remote branch, like the GitHub URL

if there is no connection to a remote branch, then you won't see a URL

We tell git we want to add a remote branch using the git remote command syntax 

git remote add name https://url.git

By convention, we call this remote branch the origin branch

git remote add origin https://url.git

In future, U want rename the remote branch or remove the remote branch Use below commands

git remote rename <old> <new>

git remote remove <name>

Once we connected to our remote branch on GitHub, we can push our code to remote branch

We tell git to push to the remote main/master branch called origin with the command 

git push -u origin main/master

If U want choose one  of  the main or master, U will use this command

git branch -M main

And then push by this command

git push -u origin main

Let's explore How to do this 

Create a new brand repo on GitHub

Repository Name : Learn_Git

Choose any one public or private , if private U need Personal Access token

Add README file if U want 

Create repo


Go back to your VS Code, In that already U have one repo , In that some files are there

To check , it's a git repository by using git status command

I want to view any remote branches to my local repo by using command 

git remote -v 

If U add that remote repo to local repo, by this command

git remote add origin  https://github.com/KCCode27/brand_new_folder.git (remote repo URL)

And then U want push ur code to remote repo

git push -u origin master ...................(master is the old name, U want change to main U use git branch -M main)

If u get error 403, that means it's private repo U want PAToken

U get personal access token and add it at before and place @ github.com 

If it is publc repo, uwon't get that errror

Ur local repo add into remote repo

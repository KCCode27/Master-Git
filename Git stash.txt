The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy.


Example :  Go to VS COde 

          Before VSCode, Create a new folder on Desktop 
		  
		      I named it as One_More_Git
		  
		      C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git status
		  
		      fatal :not a git repository (or any of the parent directories ) : .git
		  
		      C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git init
		  
		      Intialized empty git repository in C:/Users/vasudevarao/Desktop/One_More_Git/.git/
		  
		      C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git status
          On branch master

          No commits yet

          nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
		  
		     Create a new file on One_More_Git folder on branch master, named it as master.txt
		  
		     Add some text content on it --->first line commited on branch master. And then save the file.

		     C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git add master.txt
		  
		     C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git commit -m "first commit on master "
          [master (root-commit) 102a339] first commit on master
          1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
          create mode 100644 master.txt
		  
		    "Create a another branch on One_More_Git folder "
		  
		     C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git branch other
		   
		    C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git branch
           * master
           other
		   
		   C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git switch other
           Switched to branch 'other'
		   
		   "Create a new file on branch other " Named it as 'other.txt'
		    Add some text content on it --->First line on Other branch, forgot to commit
			And then save it 
			
			C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git status
            On branch other
            Untracked files:
            (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            other.txt

             nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
			 
			 "if u switch to master , U can see the other.txt file on master branch"
			 
			 C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\One_More_Git>git status
             On branch master
             Untracked files:

             other.txt

             nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
			 
			 
			 So, Then switch back to other branch and commit that file

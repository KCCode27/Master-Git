Branches : A branch represents an independent line of development

Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process

They are way to request a brand new working directory, staging area and project history

When you create a branch, all git needs to do is create a new pointer, it does not change the repository 

Upon creating a new repo with git init you create a new branch called "master" or main branch

This is a branch just like any other, but it's simply the first one created

Should code push to master branch it's always in working condition

While organization or developers often treat this master or main branch as offically branch as for deployment , but this is not the requirement,U can use any branch for code deployment 

About the Master vs Main branch

GitHub named it inital branch as Main 

but Git still using as Master but in future it will change 

You can also rename any branch

As we work with more branches, You will see a word 'HEAD' during commits

When viewing the most recent commit using git log U may see (HEAD->Master)

HEAD is always pointing the most recent commit in the  master branch

But more specificaly says 'HEAD' is simply reference the commit object

HEAD as  pointing to a specific commit in a branch that we are currently viewing

Example : Create a new folder , I named it as "myNewFolder" 

          Open it in a VS Code
		  
		  C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git status
          fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
		  
		  
          C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git init
          Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/vasudevarao/Desktop/myNewfolder/.git/
		  
		  "Now it's a repo " , create some file on this folder ,and see git branch commands
		  
		   "I am creating a file myfile.txt and add some line then commit it "
		   
		   
          C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git add myfile.txt

          C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git commit -m "My first commit"
          [master (root-commit) 7f781fc] My first commit
          1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
          create mode 100644 myfile.txt
		  
		  Now check our branch name by git branch commands
		  
		  C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git branch
          * master
		  
		  Right now we are in master branch
		  
		  Create a new branch , switch to that newly created branch
		  I gave  a new branch name as  "new_branch" and create a file on it 
		  
		  C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git branch new_branch
		  
		  C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git switch new_branch
          Switched to branch 'new_branch'
		  
		  C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git branch
          master
         * new_branch
		 
		 
         C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git add .

         C:\Users\vasudevarao\Desktop\myNewfolder>git commit -m "my second commit"
         [new_branch cdd1639] my second commit
         1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)      
         create mode 100644 mychildfile.txt
